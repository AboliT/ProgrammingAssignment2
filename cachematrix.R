## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix( )) {
 inv <- NULL 
    set <- function(y) { 
         x <<- y 
         inv <<- NULL 
     } 
     get <- function() x 
     setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse 
     getinverse <- function() inv 
     list(set=set, get=get, setinverse=setinverse, getinverse=getinverse) 
}



## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
         inv <- x$getinverse() 
     if(!is.null(inv)) { 
         message("getting cached data.") 
         return(inv) 
     } 
     data <- x$get() 
     inv <- solve(data) 
     x$setinverse(inv) 
     inv 
}
